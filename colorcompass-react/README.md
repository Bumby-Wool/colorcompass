# ColorCompass React

React front-end for ColorCompass.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ (LTS recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

From the repo root, move into the React app and install dependencies:

```bash
cd colorcompass-react
npm install
npm install react-router-dom
```

## Run the app (dev)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Build (production bundle)

You do not need this step for regular development; it is only for generating a production-ready bundle.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Preview the production build

You do not need this step for regular development; it is only for testing the production build locally.

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - start the Vite dev server
- `npm run build` - build for production
- `npm run preview` - preview the production build locally
